# Contributions to SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition Developer Guide

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our [official documentation on SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/WZ/7d3b9c7211ca4d7a9630b524205ee836/5c0103b130de411fb2a4b5416e36d767.html). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

1. Open the [SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition Developer Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/WZ/7d3b9c7211ca4d7a9630b524205ee836/5c0103b130de411fb2a4b5416e36d767.html).
1. You can either:
    * Choose *Edit* to suggest a change for the current page you see in the Help Portal viewer, or

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
