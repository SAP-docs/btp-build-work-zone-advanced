# How to Create Multimedia Playlists

Add audio files or videos to a playlist.

When you want to create a sequence of videos or audio files that play one after the other, or to provide a selection of related videos or other multimedia, you can add the collection of files to a playlist. Audio and video files can be included in more than one playlist.

To create a playlist:

1.  Go to the workspace where you want to save the playlist.
2.  Click :heavy_plus_sign: to add a *Content* navigation tab \(if you don't already have one\).
3.  Choose *\+ Create* \> *Multimedia* \> *Playlist*.
4.  In the *Create Multimedia Playlist* dialog box, enter a name for your playlist.
5.  In the *Select Multimedia* tab, choose the videos and audio files that you want to include in the playlist.
6.  If you want to include YouTube, Vimeo, or another external video, click the *Add Links to Multimedia* tab and add the hyperlinks.
7.  To save your playlist, choose *OK*.
8.  To make the playlist available for the workspace members, choose *Publish*.
