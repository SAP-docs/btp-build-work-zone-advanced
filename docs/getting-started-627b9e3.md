## Onboarding Options

The SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition/SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone onboarding guides describe the simplest approach for user authentication and provisioning, using SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication as the user management system, and SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning as the user provisioning system. However, there are other approaches that can be used, depending on your environment setup.

For example, the default onboarding flow mentions specific user group names that are mapped to role collections in SAP BTP cockpit. Same mapping is done by the SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition booster, which relies on those exact user group names from Identity Authentication. If you wish to configure this differently, you can use different group names and map them to the role collections as needed.

For more information about different configuration options, see [User Authentication, Provisioning and Authorization](user-authentication-provisioning-and-authorization-f04c185.md)
