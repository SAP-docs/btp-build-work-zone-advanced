# Add a SAML Trusted IDP

By registering an external application as a SAML trusted Identity Provider \(IDP\), you allow the application to access SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition user ID and authorization information. Users then see only the content they are authorized to view when SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition features are integrated into the external application.

For more information about managing SAML trusted IdPs, and registering a new SAML trusted IdP, refer to the Admin Guide at [SAML Trusted IdP](https://help.sap.com/docs/WZ/b03c84105ff74f809631e494bd612e83/c2f81fd55cf5451c9c6c5e3c55760d0f.html).
