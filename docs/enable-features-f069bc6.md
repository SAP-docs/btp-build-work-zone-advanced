# Enable Features

You can enable or disable features for your workspace. Which features are available, depends on the settings defined.



When you create a workspace, all features are enabled by default. You can later change the settings as follows:

1.  Go to *Workspace Admin Settings* \> *Edit Workspace*.

2.  From the *SETUP* tab under *Customize what is available in this workspace*, select which features are available for the workspace.


You can, for example, enable or disable the following:
