## Using the workpage editor

You can add content to your workspace by adding widgets from a widget gallery. These widgets include app tiles, cards, and other widgets such as forums, events, feeds, video files, images and much more.

To add content to a workpage in your workspace, use a tool called the workpage editor, which you access on the right side of your workpage by clicking the :pencil2: icon.

When you open the workpage editor, add the following content as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Content type



</th>
<th valign="top">

Description



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Apps



</td>
<td valign="top">

Click *Tiles* to display app tiles representing the apps that you can access. You can add a single app to a column or you can select multiple apps and add them side by side in a column. Here's an example of apps added one next to each other in a column:

## Add content that you create or upload

Apart from content that you can add to your workpages from the widget gallery, you can create your own content or upload it from your system. Content items are workpages, blog posts, links, videos, wiki pages, documents \(PowerPoint, Word, Excel\), decision-making tools such as polls and comparison tables as well as planning tools such as agenda, tasks, and timelines.
