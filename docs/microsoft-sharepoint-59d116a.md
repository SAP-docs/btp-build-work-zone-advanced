# Microsoft SharePoint

SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition integrates with Microsoft SharePoint.

If your workspace administrator has enabled the Microsoft SharePoint integration, you can browse all linked SharePoint repositories and documents within your workspace. Documents stored within SharePoint are view-only in the site. You can comment, annotate, like, download, mark as a featured item, and bookmark SharePoint documents. You can also copy documents or folders from a SharePoint repository to a local folder within a site.

> ### Note:  
> -   Your company VPN is not required to access your SharePoint documents.
> 
> -   This applies to document repositories using Microsoft Office 365 \(SharePoint Online\).
> -   You cannot upload or update SharePoint documents within a site. First, you must upload and update content in SharePoint before it can be viewed in a site.

Although you can access SharePoint repository content via the SharePoint menu, it does not appear in any search results and you cannot see it as a featured content item on your workspace pages. If you want to see it as a featured content item, you must copy the item to a folder. After the document is copied, it is indexed for search purposes and is then available for inclusion with content widgets on your workpages.

You can also upload new versions of the document. However, the new version does not replace the document that exists in the SharePoint repository or in the SharePoint external folder within the site.
