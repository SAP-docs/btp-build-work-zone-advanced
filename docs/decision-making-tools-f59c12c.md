# Decision Making Tools

Decision-making tools help direct the discussion in a workspace.



As a workspace member, you can add your input to decision making tools and make decisions based on the record analysis. For example, you can use a Pro/Con table to create a set of options and gather positive and negative opinions about each option.

To see all the decision making tools in a workspace, open the *Content* list of the workspace. You can open the content list by adding a *Content* menu item to your workspace. From the *Content* list, select *\+ Create* and select *Decision-Making Tools*.

The following decision making tools are available:
