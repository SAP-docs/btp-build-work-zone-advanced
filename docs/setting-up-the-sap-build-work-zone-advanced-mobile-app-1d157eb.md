## Prerequisites

To set up the SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app, you need an active SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition account.

> ### Note:  
> As of version 1.7.4, the QR code has been updated with a new certificate-based URL allowing users to easily onboard to the SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app. Keep in mind that when you upgrade to this new version, when resetting the mobile app, make sure that you select *Scan new QR code* and not *Use current application* in the popup. Users who have already scanned the previous QR code and are using the current application, will not be affected.

## Procedure

1.  Click your avatar in the site and choose *Settings* \> *Mobile Application*.

2.  Choose your operating system and choose *Install*.

    The QR code for installation is shown.

3.  Open the camera app on your smartphone and scan the QR code for installation to get a download link for the mobile app from the App Store or Play Store.

4.  Open again the *Settings* \> *Mobile Application*, and choose *Registration* and scan the QR code for registration.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you use an Android device sold in Mainland China and have downloaded the app from the Tencent app store, it's possible that you can't scan the QR code for the registration with your mobile phone. Your company administrator can send you a link for the registration in an email. You open the email in your mobile phone and tap on the link in the email to register the app. If this doesn't work either, your administrator can provide the registration link as an HTML file and you have to tap on the registration link in the HTML file to open the app.
    > 
    > For more information, see [Onboarding for Tencent Appstore Users](onboarding-for-tencent-appstore-users-2dd9d7c.md).

    Your device opens the SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app. The mobile app is now connected to the correct host.

    Alternatively, you can also scan the QR code for registration from within the SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app. You can use your deviceÂ´s camera or scan a copy of the QR code in your photo library. Your device might ask to give the mobile app the permission to access your camera or your photo library.

5.  Accept the End User License Agreement.

6.  Decide if you want to secure the access to the SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app with a passcode.

    On supported devices, you can also choose to secure the access to the SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app using a fingerprint or face scanner.

    > ### Note:  
    > The SAP Build Work Zone Advanced mobile app doesn't respect the *Supported Devices* setting that is relevant to the *Applications* page. Therefore if there are apps that you don't want to display on your mobile device, you can do the following:
    > 
    > 1.  From the Administration Console, open the *External Integrations* \> *Business Content*.
    > 
    > 2.  Click *Content Manager*.
    > 
    > 3.  Click the app that you want to hide.
    > 
    > 4.  Go to the *Navigation* tab and add or update the default value of `HiddenInMobileApp` to true in the *Parameters* section.
    > 
    > 5.  Relaunch the mobile app to see that the app you don't want displayed, has disappeared.
