# Configuring access to business records in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition

Once you have properly registered your external application, created any required annotations files, and registered your business records, your external data is available for use in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition. OData-based applications are listed in the *Business Records* page.

You can create a workspace and add a business object to it as a primary object, or you can feature a business record to share it in different workspaces.

For more information, see the User guide [Business Records](https://help.sap.com/docs/WZ/fec5ca6e3229418f84a932c745cbe985/b984753495e44afea4c7ebba30e13ee6.html).
