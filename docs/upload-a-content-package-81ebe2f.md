# Upload a Content Package

Once the developer has created the content package, it needs to be uploaded.

Content packages are uploaded in the Administration Console by the administrator in a dedicated area for managing content packages.

To upload a content package to your subaccount, do the following:

1.  Go to the Administration Console and select *UI Integration* \> *Content Packages*.

2.  On the *Content Packages* screen, click *Upload Content Package*.

3.  Select the content package ZIP file from the folder where you stored it.

    You can see the progress of the upload in the bar at the top of your screen. Once uploaded, the content package appears as a tile on your screen and its status changes to *Ready to Install*. You can also drill down and explore which content items are contained in your package.
