# Feature Enablement

In the *Feature Enablement* section, you can enable the built in features for users. In addition, you configure them to suit your corporate culture and your work processes.



## Kudos

Kudos provide a way for users to recognize each other for their accomplishments, encourage good working practices and positive personal traits, and help to establish a positive interpersonal working environment.

As a company administrator, you can globally configure whether users can grant kudos. In addition, you can add custom kudos and disable single kudos.

## Hashtags

Hashtags provide a form of auto-completion for user text entry in feed items. As a company administrator, you can create a file of the words or phrases that users can enter for the hashtag auto-completion. When the user begins writing the word or phrase in the hashtag field, and as soon as they’ve typed enough for a unique match, the word or phrase is shown in the hashtag field.

In hashtags, users can use letters, numbers, and word connectors \(such as dash and underscore\). Hashtags can’t include special characters \(such as slashes and quotes, decimal points, parentheses, and brackets\).

> ### Note:  
> We do not recommend uploading hashtags. After uploading a hashtag file, you can only remove the hashtags manually afterwards.

To add a hashtag list for autocompletion, upload a file in CSV format that contains one hashtag per line. You can also import a preconfigured list of hashtags.

## Knowledge Base Categories

As a company administrator, you can create and edit a multilevel category hierarchy for Knowledge Base articles, up to three levels deep, with up to 150 categories at each level. The hierarchy helps users to organize their articles and find them easily.

You enable this feature on the *Feature Enablement* \> *Features* screen.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

</td>
<td valign="top">

The category name is automatically updated for all published articles. When creating a new article, the renamed category is shown as a category option.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

</td>
<td valign="top">

Choose *Delete*.

Deleted categories no longer display for existing articles that used the category, and aren’t displayed as an option for new articles.

</td>
<td valign="top">

On the *Templates* tab, choose *\+ Template*, design the template, and publish it.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Edit a Knowledge Base template



</td>
<td valign="top">

Choose *Edit*. You can edit a knowledge base template's fields and options.

Changes to the template are applied to existing articles only when the article is edited and saved. When a user edits an article that is based on a template that has been revised, a message displaying at the top of the article says so. When you edit a template that has at least one article created from it, a message displays that says that any changes to the template are applied to published articles once they’re edited.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Delete a Knowledge Base template



</td>
<td valign="top">

Choose *Delete*.

You can only delete the template if there aren’t any published articles based on the template.

## Requesting to Replace Text on the Screen

You can also request site administration tasks such as customizing the texts that are displayed throughout your site.

For example, you can change all instances of the term *Kudos* that appear in profiles, feeds, buttons, and other places in the user interface, to *Recognition*, which your users may prefer. If your request is on the [list of pre-approved text](https://help.sap.com/http.svc/download?deliverable_id=20724259), it's processed. Otherwise, it's reviewed by the product team first and processed upon approval.

You can also customize translations in the languages supported by your site. For example, you can change “Send a Kudo” to “Send a Recognition”, and manually translate the new text into multiple languages. Submit a service ticket to SAP Support and provide details about the text and its translations.
