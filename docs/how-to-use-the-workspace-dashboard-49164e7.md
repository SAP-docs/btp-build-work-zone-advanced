# How to Use the Workspace Dashboard

The dashboard displays statistics about which workspace members are most active, what they are most engaged with, or which content items received the most attention.



Run your worksapce dashboard as follows:

From your workspace, open the <span class="SAP-icons">î‡ž</span> \(page navigator\) and choose *Dashboard*.

> ### Note:  
> When starting up the dashboard for the first time, you may see a message stating that it's preparing to initialize. You can navigate away from the page and return to it later. Subsequent dashboard displays for your workspace will take less time to generate.

In the dashboard, you can do the following:

-   Select a time frame for the data displayed on the dashboard.

-   Generate a print preview version of the dashboard.

-   Download a spreadsheet that contains the statistics from the dashboard.

    In the downloaded file, you can see up to 200 most engaging items and 200 most engaged members.
