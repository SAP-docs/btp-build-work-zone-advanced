<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Switch page view*

<span style="font-size:24px;line-height: 28px;"><span class="SAP-icons"></span></span>



</td>
<td valign="top">

Only visible on the *Home* page.

Area administrators for multiple areas can switch between area home page views.

The home page switcher lets you quickly choose a home page to view and edit. You can:

-   Select a tab representing either *Full Access Users* or *External Users*.

    For that user type, select either Company or a specific area.

-   You can also edit the company announcement for *Full Access Users*.

<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Edit* 

<span style="font-size:24px;line-height: 28px;"><span class="SAP-icons"></span></span>



</td>
<td valign="top">

This opens the workpage editor from where you can do the following:

-   Click *Add Widget* on a workpage section to open the widget gallery. From here, you can select a variety of app tiles, cards, and widgets with various content types such as images, feeds, forums, events, and more.

-   Click :pencil2: on the widget to edit various widget settings.

    For more information about cards, see [About Cards](about-cards-a202464.md).

    For more information about widgets, see [About Widgets](about-widgets-5a73a41.md)

-   Change the layout of the workpage by moving and resizing the widgets.

-   Click :gear: to set the background color of your workpage and define how the different sections on the workpage are displayed.

By editing a workpage, you create a new version. If you want to make the new version visible for other workspace members or users, you have to publish it. If you don't want to publish the new version immediately, you can save the changes as a draft.

The next time you open the workspace you can view and edit your draft. To revert to an old version of a workpage, select the version that you want to revert to.
