# Company Feed

By default, you see a summary of all status updates posted by people you follow or in workspaces of which you are a member. You can choose which items you see in your feed updates by using feed filters.

## Custom Filters

You can create, edit, or delete your own filters. For example, you can create a member filter to see content from a particular colleague. If you find that a filter is no longer useful, you can delete it from your list.

To create, edit, or delete a custom filter on your company feed:

1.  At the top of your company feed, from the dropdown menu, choose *Show More*.

2.  From the dropdown list, select *Manage Filters*.
3.  In the *Manage Filters* popup window, you can do the following:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Action


    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    More Info


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Create a filter


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    1.  Choose *Create a New Filter*.

    2.  In the popup window, enter a filter name and select a filter type from the dropdown list.

        -   To create a filter based on specific colleagues, choose *Member filter*.

        -   To create a feed based on one or more workspaces, choose *Workspace filter*.

    3.  Choose *Submit*.



    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Edit a filter


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Choose the

    :pencil2: icon.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Delete a filter


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Choose the :x: icon.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
4.  Save your filter.

    > ### Tip:  
    > You can rearrange the filters by dragging and dropping the filter names. You can move frequently used filters to the top of the list, so you do not have to scroll through the list.


To access your filters, at the top of your company feed, choose *Show More*.
