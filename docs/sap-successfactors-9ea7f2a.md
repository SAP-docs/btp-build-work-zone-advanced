## SAP SuccessFactors Learning

> ### Note:  
> This capability is only relevant to SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone.

By integrating SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone with a social learning management system such as SuccessFactors Learning, a workspace in SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone can be created from a curriculum, learning item, or scheduled offering. Course administrators \(who are workspace administrators\) can create social learning workspaces. They can use a specific learning template \(for example, Education Center, Training Room templates\), provide a community for instructors to moderate forums and enable students to share information with instructors and peers.

> ### Note:  
> If your company has deployed only the SAP SuccessFactors Learning integration, the names, widgets, and other page labels have been adapted to reflect the learning context:
> 
> -   The *Business Records* link in the top menu bar is renamed to *Learning*.
> -   For workspace administrators, the *Business Records* widget is renamed to *Learning*.
> -   All instances of business records are replaced with learning-specific terminologies where applicable.

When you browse for curricula and items in the item browser, you can sort the results by various attributes.

> ### Note:  
> If a hover card or attribute shows a *Value not found* error, please notify your company administrator. They can take steps to correct the issue via the Admin Center in the SuccessFactors HCM Suite.



### Learning Items

You can filter the learning item results by any of the following options: *Instructor-Led*, *Online*, *Other Learning*, or *All*.

When you hover over the item's name, a hover card displays information such as the Item ID, Description, or Chargeback Method. You can also create a workspace or feature the record for the learning item in a specific workspace.

When a workspace is created from a learning item using the *Education Center* or *Training Room* workspace templates, the learning item information displays on the workpage. The same information is displayed as on the hover card. In the workspace navigation menu, when you click the learning item's details, you can also see the *Scheduled Offering Details*. The following details are included:

-   Location
-   Start date and time per location timezone
-   End date and time per location
-   Status
-   Enrollment status that shows whether you ae enrolled in that course offering or not



### Scheduled Offerings

Under the Scheduled Offerings tab for an item, the ID and Description can display along with the start and end date times, location, available seats, and enrollment status for a scheduled offering.

In the item viewer, the hover card for a scheduled offering displays the following information:

-   *Title*
-   *Scheduled Offering ID*
-   *Description*
-   *Available Seats*
-   *Enrollment Status*
-   *Contact information*
-   *Email Address*
-   In which workspaces the offering has been featured.

You can also create a workspace \(using the Training Room or Education Center templates\) based on the scheduled offering, or featured the scheduled offering in a workspace.

You can use the global search to search for scheduled offerings and curriculum by title. In the item viewer, you can search by title or ID. When viewing an item via the item viewer, you can click and navigate into each related scheduled offering.



### Curriculum

You can click *Curriculum Details* in the left side menu navigation to access a curriculum. When you click on the learning type *Curriculum*in the item browser, you see a list of curricula that has been assigned to you. When you hover over each assigned curriculum to view the hover card, you can see the *Curriculum ID*, *Description*, *Status* \(that is, *Complete* or *Incomplete*\), and which workspaces it has already been featured in. The curriculum status is a reflection of whether all assignments have been completed or not. If all assignments are completed, then the overall status displays *Complete*. If any of the assignments are not completed, then the overall status displays *Incomplete*.

You can also create a workspace \(using the *Training Room* and *Education Center* templates\) based on the curriculum, or feature the curriculum in a workspace. If you click on curriculum that has not been assigned to you, then no information appears in the hover card when you hover over it.

When you click *Related Learning* from the navigation menu, the item viewer can display a list of curriculum assignments.

When viewing curriculum using the item viewer, users can click and navigate into each curriculum assignment.

SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone offers a link back to LMS to connect you to an exact page or action that reflects the next step in your process \(for example, enrollment in a course, viewing a curriculum\).
