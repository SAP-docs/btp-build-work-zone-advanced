# Assign Apps to Roles

Assign your apps to a role so that all users assigned to this same role, can access the apps.

Content assigned to the default `Everyone` role is visible to all users.



1.  Open the *Content Manager*.

2.  From the *My Content* tab, in the *Items* list, you'll see the roles that currently exist in your subaccount.

    -   For a local app that you created in the *Content Manager*, you can either create a new role and assign your app to it, or you can assign your app to another existing role in your subaccount.

    -   For a remote app that you added from a content provider, simply add the role from the content provider in the *Content Explorer*.


3.  Select the role to open the role editor and click *Edit*.

4.  In the *Assignments* panel on the right, search for your app.

5.  In the *Results* list, click :heavy_plus_sign: next to the apps you want to assign to the selected role. You'll see that the icon changes.

6.  Click *Save*.
