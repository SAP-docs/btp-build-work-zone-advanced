# Workspace Feed

Your workspace feed displays a summary of the latest activities within your private and public workspaces. Workspace feeds can include recently uploaded or edited documents, discussions, or questions related to a workspace.

## Workspace Feed Actions

From a workspace feed, the same actions are available as from your company feed. See [Company Feed](company-feed-863f91b.md).

If forums are enabled for your workspace, you can ask a question, add an idea, or start a discussion.

1.  When you choose one of the following actions, a rich text editor opens for the text box.

    ****


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    What it does


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    <span class="SAP-icons"></span>


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Ask a question


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    :bulb:


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Add an idea


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    <span class="SAP-icons"></span>


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Add a discussion


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
2.  In the bottom-left corner of the text box, there is a dropdown menu from which you can choose the following actions:

    -   *Attach Existing File*
    -   *Upload New File*
    -   *Add a Tag*
    -   *Mention Someone*

3.  On the bottom bar, from the dropdown list, choose where you want to post your question, idea, or discussion. You can choose from forum topics that you created or forum topics that other members shared with you.
