## Activity

You can share an update from the text box at the top of your company feed or from a workspace feed.

A post can contain different types of content. For example, you can share documents, blogs, videos, photos, forum topics, and general status updates. You can address workspace members, colleagues, public member lists, or specific business records \(for example, learning items\) using @mention or you can include tags in a feed item to help others find your post. As users interact with a post, the most recent activity is displayed at the top of the feed.
