# UI Integration Cards

Integration cards present a new means to expose application content to the end user in a unified way.

A card is a design pattern that displays the most concise pieces of information in a limited-space container. Similar to a tile, it helps users structure their work in an intuitive and dynamic way.

Cards are composite controls that follow a predefined structure and offer content in a specific context. Cards contain the most important information for a given object \(usually a task, or a list of business entities\). You can use cards for presenting information, which can be displayed in flexible layouts that work well across a variety of screens and window sizes.

> ### Note:  
> UI Card Editor currently supports all card features available in SAP UI5 version 1.87.0.
