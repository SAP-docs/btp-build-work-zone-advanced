# Forums

To discuss ideas with the members of your workspace or to ask them questions and find solutions together, you can use forums. Forums structure your exchange of ideas and become a knowledge base where you can later look up topics that were already discussed or questions that were already answered.



You find the forums on the *Forums* page tab of the workspace. There are different types of forums for different purposes. Your workspace administrator defines which of the following forum types are enabled for the workspace:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

</th>
<th valign="top">

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Questions* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

In a *Question* forum, every forum item is a question.

Workspace members can reply to a question by posting a comment as an answer.

Question creators and workspace administrators mark the best answer to indicate to everyone that the question has been resolved.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Ideas* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

In an *Ideas* forum, every forum item is an idea. You post an idea to share it with other workspace members and get feedback from them.

Workspace members can reply to an idea by voting for the idea or by posting comments.

In the single item view of an idea, workspace administrators can set the status of the idea.

-   You can also create questions, ideas, and discussions in the text box of the workspace feed. When creating a question, idea, or discussion, select the forum for which you want to create it.

### Read-only Questions, Ideas, or Discussions

Workspace administrators can set questions, ideas, or discussions within a selected forum to read-only so that members can no longer contribute to them. These questions, ideas, or discussions are closed to further comments or edits.
