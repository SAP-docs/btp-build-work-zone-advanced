# Top Disk Usage per Workspace or User Report

These reports show information about each user or workspace listed, depending on which report you selected. You can view how much disk storage is being consumed by each user or by each workspace.

> ### Note:  
> -   In addition to these reports, notifications are sent to company administrators when they are at 80% and 100% of their storage allocation. If you receive an "80% usage" notification, you should either free up storage by deleting old content or contact your SAP Jam Support representative to purchase more storage space. If you receive a "100% usage" notification, your users will no longer be able to upload content, so acting to resolve the problem becomes vital. These notifications occur daily, are not configurable, and cannot be turned off. The configuration required to ensure that you \(administrators\) receive these notifications is described in [Configuring Notification Emails](configuring-notification-emails-6076729.md).
> -   Data is included for area and company home page content repositories.
