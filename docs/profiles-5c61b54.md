# Profiles

You can specify which information is displayed on the user profile page.

The user profile pages display information so that other users can get to know and contact them. Basic information is displayed by default. In a user profile, users can choose to display additional information for each user profile that they're currently viewing.

As a company administrator, you can do the following in the *Area and Workspace* \> *Profiles* screen:

-   Choose which profile sections are displayed

-   Reorder the profile sections by dragging and dropping them

-   For profile sections that are composed of several entries, an *Edit* link is available for you to refine the profile information to be displayed


> ### Note:  
> To ensure your company's compliance with data privacy regulations, make sure that sensitive personal data isn't stored in any profile fields.
