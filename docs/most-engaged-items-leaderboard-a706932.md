# Most engaged items leaderboard

In the expanded Most engaged items table, the top 10 most engaged items are listed in order of total number of activities.

Each item is assigned a value, which is the sum of views, likes, comments, and uploads the item received from all workspace members in that time frame. The blue bar behind each item indicates its ranking relative to the leader, which is always assigned a full bar. Clicking on each item takes you to the item content page.

An option to filter by content type is included so you can refine the leaderboard display. The content types that appear in the drop-down filter depend on what content was uploaded, viewed, liked, and commented on within the selected time frame.

You can choose to exclude workspace administrators so that the calculation of the top 10 most engaging items for the selected time frame removes all workspace administrators' contributions.

> ### Note:  
> -   If the content item owner is also the workspace administrator, and you choose to exclude workspace administrators from the calculation \(see the drop-down menu on the far right side of the expanded tile\), that means that all workspace administrator contributions to that content item will be removed, while everyone else's contributions will still be part of the calculation.
> -   Workspace workpage views are not factored into the calculation for most engaged items leaderboard.
