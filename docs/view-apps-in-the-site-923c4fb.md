# View Apps in the Site

View business apps in the *Applications* page of your site.

Once you've assigned your apps to the same role as your site, and once you've assigned your apps to a group, the apps are displayed in their group as tiles in the *Applications* page of your site. You can access this page from the top menu bar of your site.

1.  Click :globe_with_meridians: in the left navigation panel to open the Site Directory.

2.  Click <span class="SAP-icons">ÓÅö</span> to open your site.

3.  Click the *Applications* menu item.

    A page displays the apps \(as tiles\) that you configured in the *Content Manager*. These are the business apps that you have permissions to access.

    In the next topic, you'll learn how to add these apps to the workpages in your site. For more information, see [Add Apps to Your Workpages](add-apps-to-your-workpages-e7c9cef.md).
