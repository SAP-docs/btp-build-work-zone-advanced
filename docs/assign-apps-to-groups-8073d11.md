# Assign Apps to Groups

To make sure that your apps are visible in the *Applications* page of your site, assign your apps to one or more groups.

A group is a set of one or more apps displayed together on a page. To assign an app to a group, do the following:



1.  Open the *Content Manager*.

2.  From the *My Content* tab, select a group in the *Items* list or create a new group by clicking *\+New* \> *Group*.

3.  In the group editor that opens, click *Edit*.

4.  In the *Assignments* panel on the right of the screen, click inside the search box to show all available apps.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you have many apps, you can type a few letters of your app name in the search bar to limit the search results.

5.  In the *Results* list, click :heavy_plus_sign: next to the apps you want to assign to your selected group. You'll see that the icon changes.

6.  Click *Save*.
