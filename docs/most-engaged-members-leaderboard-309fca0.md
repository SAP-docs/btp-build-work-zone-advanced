# Most engaged members leaderboard

The leaderboard shows the top 10 members ranked by the total number of activities for the time frame selected. It only displays when the user level reporting company setting is enabled in the SAP Jam Admin console.

Each member is assigned a value which is the sum of views, likes, comments, and uploads the member contributed to all items in the group in that time frame. The blue bar behind each member indicates their ranking relative to the leader, who is always depicted with a full bar. Clicking on each member takes you to the profile page for that member.

> ### Note:  
> If comments have been made by a user in another group for a content item and that same item is moved to your group, those comments will also be moved to the comment wall for that content item in your group. As a result, that user from the other group will be counted as an engaged member within your group.

You can choose to exclude group administrators from the calculation of the top 10 most engaging members for the selected time frame.

> ### Note:  
> If you choose to exclude group administrators from the calculation \(see the drop-down menu on the far right side of the expanded tile\), no group administrators will display in the leaderboard.

> ### Note:  
> Group overview page views are not factored into the calculation for the most engaged items leaderboard.
