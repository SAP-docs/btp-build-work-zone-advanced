# About Workpages

A workpage is a regular page that is used in a workspace. Workpages can exist as stand-alone entities in the site menu or workspace navigation bar, and they can be nested under another workpage.

When you add content to your site, you add it to a workpage.

Workpages are slightly different to a regular page in that they have a more flexible layout. A workpage has a grid layout composed of sections and each section can have up to six columns to which you add your content. If a column isn't wide enough, the content wraps within the column.

When you add a new workpage, you can select from various out-of-the-box layouts or you can create your own layout by adding sections and columns. When you create the workpage, it opens in edit mode, which allows you to access the workpage editor where you can:

-   Add apps, cards, and many other widget types.

-   Add sections, columns, and widgets.

-   Use the various widget and section settings to design your workpage.


Once youâ€™re done designing your workpage, you can publish it for everyone in the workspace to see. You can also save it as a draft and come back later and finish it.
