The horizontal bar indicator shows the percentage of the purchased storage space used, the numeric values for the total amount of cloud storage that your company has purchased, and the amount of storage used. In SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition, all customers get 1TB by default \(with the option of additional storage packages\).

> ### Note:  
> Notifications are sent to company administrators when storage use reaches 80% and 100% of their allocation.
> 
> -   If you receive an 80% usage notification, you should free up storage by deleting old content or contact support to purchase more storage space.
> 
> -   If you receive a 100% usage notification, users will no longer be able to upload content.
> 
> 
> Repeated notifications will be sent every week until the situation is resolved. If your company has purchased additional storage space, an email notification will be sent when you have only 90% available storage space rather than 80%.
