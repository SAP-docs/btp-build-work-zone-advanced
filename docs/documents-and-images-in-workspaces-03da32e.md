# Documents and Images in Workspaces

You can upload documents and images to a workspace. The uploaded items can later be downloaded or checked out for editing. You can also upload new versions of documents and images.

## Uploading Files

You can upload one or more files at the same time to the *Content* page of your workspace. Note that the files that you upload for your workspace are maintained in your workspace. You cannot maintain workspace content from the Content section of your own profile, as the content stored there is independent of workspace content.

To upload one or more files, on the *Content* page of a workspace, choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> .

File types that can be uploaded include spreadsheets, PDFs, slides, and documents. Some content may provide a preview.

You can open the following Microsoft Office files and edit them directly in the site. Previews are also available:

-   PowerPoint presentations

-   Excel spreadsheets

-   Word documents


You can upload the following file formats for images:

-   JPEG

-   JPG

-   PNG

-   GIF

-   BMP

-   WBMP


If enabled by your company administrator, you can download, view, and print PDFs in the browser. If this is not enabled, iPDFs can be downloaded with the option to open or save them in a PDF viewer.



### Setting Permissions and Publish Settings

You can set permissions for the documents and images that you upload. For more information, see [Content Permissions](content-permissions-8f317cb.md).

You can also specify to automatically publish a document at a later date, and you can set an expiry date after which the document is no longer visible. To make these settings, in the *Upload Files* dialog under *Settings*, choose *Options*. For more information, see [Publish Settings](publish-settings-b69d86a.md).

> ### Tip:  
> To restrict the access to documents to selected users, you can also save them in access-restricted folders. For more information, see [How to Work With Workspace Folders](how-to-work-with-workspace-folders-b589340.md).

## Checking Out and Checking In Documents

To edit a document that is saved in workspace, you have to open it in the single item view. When you check out a document, it is displayed as checked out to other users and they cannot check out, edit, upload a new version, delete, edit permissions, or edit publishing settings for the document.

When you check in a document, other users can again work on the document.

## Uploading New Versions

You can replace existing documents or images with new or other versions of that document or image. To upload a new version, choose the document or file and then choose *Upload New Version*, or go to the *Content* page, open the actions menu for the content item and choose *Upload New Version*.

When you open a content item in single item view, you can view the version history by clicking the number next to *Versions* to the right of the document. The most recent versions are listed, along with the time elapsed since it was uploaded and the name of the user who uploaded it.

## Downloading Files

On the *Content* page tab of a workspace, you can select multiple files or content folders and choose the <span class="SAP-icons"></span> menu and then *Download selected items …* to download them in a single zip file.

As the content owner or as a workspace administrator, you can track the number of times a particular content item has been downloaded, who downloaded the item, and the version that they downloaded. When you open a content item in single item view, you can see the number of downloads. Click the number of downloads to display the names of workspace members who downloaded the item and the version number that they downloaded.
