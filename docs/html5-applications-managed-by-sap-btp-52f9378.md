# HTML5 Applications Managed by SAP BTP

HTML5 applications consist of static content that runs on a browser. With the managed application router, you can develop your applications - either in SAP Business Application Studio, or in your own IDE \(integrated development environment\) - and deploy them to the HTML5 Application Repository.

Depending on your backend application setup, you either configure the destinations during development, or define them after deploying the application. Finally, you can define a custom domain and run the applications in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition.

For more information about how to develop HTML5 applications, see the [Developing HTML5 Applications for SAP Build Work Zone, Advanced Edition](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9a1ee2f87b63473ca9fcca77158b56a5/Cloud/en-US) guide.
