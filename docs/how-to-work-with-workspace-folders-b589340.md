## Extract zipped content to a workspace folder

If you’re a workspace administrator, you can upload a zipped file containing content items into your workspace's content folder.

1.  Open your workspace and click <span class="SAP-icons"></span> and choose *Workspace Admin Settings*.

2.  Click *Extract Zip to Content*.

3.  Browse your local machine for the zip file you want to upload and extract. Click *Open*.

    Choose the folder that you want to upload the content to, set the permissions on the file, and then click *Import*.

4.  A confirmation message appears; an email notification is sent once the files are successfully uploaded. Click *OK* to dismiss the dialog.


> ### Note:  
> The following conditions should be observed:
> 
> -   File items in a single zipped file can’t exceed a maximum of 2000.
> 
> -   The size of the zip file can’t be larger than 2.14 GB.
> 
> -   The maximum number of nested folders is 9.
> 
> -   To ensure that the extracted files, once uploaded, aren’t mangled, it is recommended that you use an up-to-date zip tool \(for example, 7zip\) to create the correct zip file.
> 
> -   In the Parameters field for 7zip zipped files, you must enter "cu" to force UTF-8 filenames.
