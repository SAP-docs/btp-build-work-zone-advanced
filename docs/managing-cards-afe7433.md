## How to manage your cards



From the *Cards* screen you can:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Task



</th>
<th valign="top">

Description



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Upload a custom card.



</td>
<td valign="top">

Upload custom cards that a developer has created. In this case, the developer sends you a ZIP file with the card files and you simply click *Upload Card*.

The card is disabled by default.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Enable a card.



</td>
<td valign="top">

Enable cards by using the toggle button on the card tile. By doing this, you're making the card available to users to add to a workpage.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Define access to a card.



</td>
<td valign="top">

Once you've uploaded and enabled a UI integration card, the card can be embedded into any workpage for all members to see. To limit the access to a specific card, you can do the following:

1.  On the card tile, click the overflow icon <span class="SAP-icons"></span> on the right and select *Card Access List*. You can see that the card has unrestricted access by default.

2.  To restrict access to the card, select the *Restricted Access* radio button.

3.  Select only the places from where the card can be accessed. For example, if you want the card to be accessed from the Home Page, you need to select the checkbox next to *Home Page*.

4.  To enable the card to be selected only from specific workspaces, click *Selected Workspaces*, search for the workspaces, and then add them to the list.

5.  Click *Save*.

    Now, if you go to any workspace that you've added to the list, you'll find the card in the widget gallery under the *Cards* category. If the workspace isn’t added to the list, the card won't appear in the widget gallery for selection.

Navigate directly to where a card is used.



</td>
<td valign="top">

Each card tile displays how often it's used in your site and gives a detailed list where it appears. Click the workspace name to navigate directly to the workpage where the card is used.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Configure a custom card.



</td>
<td valign="top">

You can only do this if the developer has enabled customization.

You can also configure the Web Content Card - this is an out-of-the-box card that administrators and users can customize.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Download a card.



</td>
<td valign="top">

Download a version of a card and create a new version that you can later upload.

> ### Note:  
> If a card is part of a content package, download a local copy of the card. To prevent overriding the original version of the card, add a prefix to the file name that you can easily identify.
> 
> The prefix segments should each be separated by a dot and contain at least 3 characters, not including numbers, white spaces, or special characters.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Disable a card.



</td>
<td valign="top">

Disable a card by using the toggle button to prevent a user from adding it to a workpage or workspace.

> ### Note:  
> If a card is already used on a workpage, and you disable it, an empty container displays on the page. So, be careful before you disable a card - make sure that you first remove it from the workpage where it appears.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Delete a card.

> ### Note:  
> You can only delete a card or widget that you've uploaded.



</td>
<td valign="top">

You can only delete content that you’ve uploaded. Out-of-the-box cards, or cards that are part of a content package, can't be deleted.

> ### Note:  
> Again, if you delete it, an empty container displays on the page - so make sure that you first remove it from the workpage.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Filter cards.



</td>
<td valign="top">

You can filter the cards depending on their source by selecting one of the following providers: Out-Of-The-Box, Uploaded, or those that are provided in a Content Package.
