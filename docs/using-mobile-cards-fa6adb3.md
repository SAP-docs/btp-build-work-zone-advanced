# Using Mobile Cards

SAP Mobile Cards for iOS and Android enable you to share data from your desktop computer to your mobile device.

If you are using UI integration cards that display content from other applications in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition, you can add these cards to the SAP Mobile Cards app to store them in a single deck of cards.
