# Collaboration score graph

The collaboration score workspace displays group scores over the selected time frame.

It gives workspace administrators a quick way to identify any historical trends and take appropriate action. Scores are calculated at the end of each week \(Saturday\) and plotted. Hovering over each data point allows you to inspect the overall score for that week, and its breakdown of follower score, email subscribers score, and engaged users score.

Workspace administrators can choose to view the last 4 weeks, last 3 months, last 6 months, and last 12 months data.
