# HTTP Methods

The appropriate HTTP method, or verb, must be set for each API call.

Similarly to most REST implementations, which use POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods to perform create, retrieve, update, and delete \(CRUD\) operations, the SAP Jam OData API uses POST, GET, PATCH, or DELETE operations.

Both this SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition OData API Tutorial and theSAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition OData API Reference show clearly which method must be used for any API call.
