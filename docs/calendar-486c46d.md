# Calendar

Your calendar displays three types of date-driven activities: Tasks, events, and away alerts.





### Opening your Calendar

1.  On the menu bar, choose *Tools*.

2.  From the dropdown list, select *Calendar*.




### Calendar View

To the left of your calendar, the following sections are available:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

</th>
<th valign="top">

What you can do



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can filter the calendar view by category \(color coded\), priority \(all, high, normal, or low\), or tag \(\#\).

To expand the filter menu, choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span>.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td>
<td valign="top">

You can create a new away alert by choosing *\+ Away Alert* or delete an existing away alert by selecting <span class="SAP-icons"></span>. For more information, see [How to Set Up Your User Profile](how-to-set-up-your-user-profile-a80f406.md).



</td>
</tr>
</table>



### Tasks

Tasks are action items that you can create and assign to yourself or others. You can delegate and track important tasks that are related to feed updates. If a task has a due date, the due date of the task is displayed in the calendar.

For more informaton, see [Tasks](tasks-8b083e5.md).



### Events

Events are used to schedule activities, invite other workspace members to activities, and manage attendance.

For more information, see [Events](events-68ff1db.md).



### Away Alerts

Away alerts allow you to inform your colleagues about when you are away. Colleagues see this information next to your name whenever they enter your name or search for you in the site. They can then make plans to defer or delegate work in your absence.

> ### Note:  
> Away alerts do not synchronize with the Microsoft Outlook out-of-office feature.

In each workspace of which you are a member, your fellow workspace members can view your enabled alerts in the workspace calendar by clicking the away alert category. External users cannot enter away alerts nor can they view your alerts.
