# Enabling External Folders and Repositories

As a workspace administrator, you enable external repositories for your workspace.

Documents and other content that is stored in integrated external applications, such as Microsoft SharePoint, can be displayed in an external content widget in a workspace.

> ### Note:  
> Your company administrator first has to integrate the external applications.

You enable the external folders in the *Workspace Admin Settings*:

1.  In the workspace, open the <span class="SAP-icons">î‡²</span> menu and choose *Workspace Admin Settings*.

2.  Choose *Edit Workspace*.

3.  On the *SETUP* tab page, choose *Add external folder* for the external application that you want to use in the workspace.

4.  Select the folders or repositories that you want to use in the external content widgets.


After enabling the external folders, you can use the page designer tool to add the external content widgets to your workspace.
