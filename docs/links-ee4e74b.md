# Links

If the members of a workspace frequently access specific web pages, external web applications, or folders in the workspace, it can be convenient to display links to them permanently in a *Content* widget or on a *Content* page tab. For this purpose, you can create links as content items.

Links can be URLs to other websites or documents within a workspace. You can organize, view, edit, delete, rename, and restore deleted links.



## Creating Links

You can create links only in workspaces.

1.  Go to the *Content* page of a workspace.

2.  From the *\+ Create* dropdown menu, select *Link*.

3.  In the *Add Link* window, enter a URL.

    If the URL is valid and contains the relevant metadata, the preview, title, and description is displayed when shared in a workspace feed.

4.  Click *Share* to post the link on the feed.
