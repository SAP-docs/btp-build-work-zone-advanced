# Configure a business record filter

Many External Application Objects come with predefined filters that narrow the range of data that is displayed in a UI object.

**To add an external object filter:**

2.  Select *External Integrations* \> *External Solutions* from the left navigation panel.

4.  Click *Filters* beside the record type to which you want to add a filter.

    The *Manage <name of business record\> Filters* page is displayed.

5.  Click *New Filter*.

    The *Manage <name of business record\> Filters* page is displayed.
