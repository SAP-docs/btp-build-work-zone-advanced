# Membership tile

The membership tile displays the average count of members, followers, email subscribers, and engaged users for a selected time frame. "Active" refers to any user who has logged into SAP Jam at least once since the company's instance of SAP Jam was created.

-   **Members:** average number of active workspace members.
-   **Followers:** average number of active workspace members who follow a workspace to receive regular updates in their home feed.
-   **Email subscribers:** average number of active workspace members who subscribe to immediate, daily, or weekly workspace email notifications; members who do not specify a preference inherit the workspace setting by default.
-   **Engaged users:** average number of active group members who interact with content in the workspace.

Click the *View Details* link at the bottom of the tile to view line graphs and pie charts that visually represent the metrics. See [Membership graph](membership-graph-b488153.md) for more information.

> ### Note:  
> The time frame period prior to the workspace creation is not included in calculation for averages. For example, if today's date is December 31, 2018, and the workspace was created on October 1, 2018, you could view an average count for the last three months. However, if you wanted to see an average for the last six months \(as in, starting July 1, 2018\), as no data would be available for July 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018, the average for the last 6 months would ignore the first 3 months of that 6 month period. That means the 3 month average for October 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 would display.
