## Next steps

-   If your organization uses unrecognized or self-signed certificates for network access, or if you want to ensure a more secure connection to your document repository, proceed with adding a trusted certificate authority. See [Add a Trusted Certificate Authority](add-a-trusted-certificate-authority-0f5c6b2.md).
-   Browse all linked SharePoint repositories and documents within your workspace. For more information, see [**Microsoft SharePoint**](https://help.sap.com/docs/WZ/fec5ca6e3229418f84a932c745cbe985/59d116a174cf42458e1cafd75cff286b.html).
