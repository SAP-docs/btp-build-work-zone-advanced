# Recommendations

Recommendations are content items that are most viewed, featured, or liked.

SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition creates recommendations for you based on the items that you liked, commented on, followed, bookmarked, or where you were @mentioned. The list of recommended content is different depending on whether you are viewing it within a workspace or whether you look it up at the company level.

-   Workspace level

    Within a workspace, go to the *Recommendations* page to see the recommended, most viewed, featured, or liked content in that workspace. Recommendations can be filtered based on timelines \(for example, this month, this week, today\).

-   Company level

    Recommended content based on the number of views, likes, highest ratings, or whether it is featured is also available in the top menu under *Tools* \> *Recommendations*.

    If you want to see more content, choose *More*.

    You can then filter the content by the following criteria:

    -   Timeline \(for example, last week or last month etc.\)

    -   Recommendation qualifier \(for example, most viewed, highest rated, etc.\)

    -   Suggested people

    -   Suggested workspaces
