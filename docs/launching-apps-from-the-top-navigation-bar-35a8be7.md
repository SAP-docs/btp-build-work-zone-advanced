# Launching Apps from the Top Navigation Bar

The *All My Apps* navigation option allows users to quickly access all the apps that they have permissions to use, from anywhere in their site.

> Business apps are displayed in the *Home Page Apps* category. This is an applications home page and shouldn't be confused with the site home page.

1.  From the *Content Manager* screen, use the left-side navigation bar to open the Site Directory.
2.  Click :gear: on the site's tile to open the *Site Settings* screen.
3.  Click *Edit*.
4.  In the *Display on the screen* category, select *Yes* under *All My Apps* and save your settings.
