## What are Content Packages

Content packages are a collection of content artifacts that are built and delivered together through a ZIP file. You can create content packages for internal usage such as for testing or demo purposes, or you can create content packages for distributing content for customers.

Content Packages can contain the following content artifacts:

-   UI Integration cards
-   Workflows
-   Workspace templates
-   Exported workspace and homepage

## Content Package Types

There are two types of content packages available for customers:

-   Centrally-provided content packages: content packages that are available to all SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition customers and do not require a manual upload. These content packages cannot be downloaded or customized but they need to be installed by the administrator before using the content artifacts.
-   Local content packages: content packages developed by the customer and manually uploaded to the subaccount by the administrator. These content packages also need to be installed by the administrator before using the content artifacts.

For more information about the sample content packages, see [Project Templates for Content Packages](https://github.com/SAP-samples/workzone-content-package-templates).
