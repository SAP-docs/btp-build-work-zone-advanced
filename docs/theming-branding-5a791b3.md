# Theming & Branding

Theming is the process of adjusting the look and feel or graphical appearance of the screens in your site. Branding is the process of applying a product or company brand to the screens in your site.

From this section in the Administration Console you can apply themes and brand your site using the following available options:

<tr>
<td valign="top">

*Theme Manager*



</td>
<td valign="top">

From this screen, you can directly access the Theme Manager where you can:

-   -   Assign themes to your site. Once you assign themes to a particular site, end users can then select one of the assigned themes.

-   Create your own custom theme by launching the UI theme designer directly from the *Theme Manager*.

    > ### Note:  
    > The UI theme designer lets you modify theme templates provided by SAP or edit one of the existing custom themes. For example, you can choose a different color scheme or logo.

-   Disable your current company theme \(that you created in the local theme designer\).

    > ### Note:  
    > You need to disable any theme you created locally in order to use one of the themes from the *Theme Manager*.

From this screen, you can create local themes for your site.

> ### Note:  
> We recommend that you use the Theme Manager to manage your themes as local themes only partially affect the user interface.
