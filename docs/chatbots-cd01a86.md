## How to Chat

You can open the chatbot from most pages in the site. The exception is the *Applications* page.

1.  In the bottom-right corner of a page, choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> .

    A chat window opens.

2.  If there are multiple bots configured for your site, select the one most suitable for you.

3.  At the bottom of the window, in the chat bar, type a question or write what you want to do.

    For example, you can ask the chatbot to create a new workspace for you.

4.  Choose <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(send\).

    You can also press [Ctrl/Shift\] + [enter\]  \(Windows\) or [command\] + [enter\]  \(Mac\).


If the chatbot does not understand your question, it replies with "I trigger the fallback skill because I don't understand or I don't know what I'm supposed to do...".
