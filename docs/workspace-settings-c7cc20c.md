# Workspace Settings

Administrators of a workspace can configure a number of settings that apply to the workspace.



Everyone who creates a workspace is automatically assigned as an administrator of that workspace. There is also the option to assign other workspace members as administrators of a particular workspace.

The workspace settings that you define can determine how workspace members can engage and interact within the workspace.

To access these settings, do the following:

On your workspace, click <span class="SAP-icons">î‡²</span> and then click *Workspace Admin Settings*.

In the *Workspace Admin Settings* dropdown list, click *Edit Workspace*. There are three tabs with settings that you can configure for the workspace:
