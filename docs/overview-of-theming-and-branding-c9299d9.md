## Overview

Themes are created in a browser-based tool called the UI theme designer. It has a WYSIWYG designer to make it easy to create and maintain custom themes. By simply changing theme parameter values, images, and other resources, you can create your own themes with your corporate brand, corporate colors, and company logo.

## How to apply the themes to your site

A default standard theme provided by SAP is assigned to your site.

You can choose a different SAP standard theme \(out-of-the-box\) or you can create a custom theme based on one of the standard themes.

Once a theme is saved and published, it's automatically registered in the Theme Manager of your site.

In the Theme Manager, you can select whether you want to set this theme as the default theme for the site. You can also let users select a theme on their own with the *Enable User Selection* button. Users can then go to their *Settings* screen and select any theme you've made available to them and apply it to their sites.

The overall process is as follows:
