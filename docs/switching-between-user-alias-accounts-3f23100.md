# Switching Between User Alias Accounts

If you're assigned to one or more user alias accounts, you can easily switch between them or you can go back to your primary user account.

## Background

When the administrator creates a user alias account, they would typically give the account a different name or a nickname - something that represents a specific area or department in your organization. For example, if you work in the HR department and are assigned to a user alias account called `HR HelpDesk`, you can use this alias account name to answer any HR-related questions without having to use your personal user name. More users can be assigned to the `HR HelpDesk` alias account and will also be able to answer HR-related questions from other users.

For more information about how to configure alias users, see [Alias Accounts.](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b03c84105ff74f809631e494bd612e83/Cloud/en-US/8857401c21b94dec9143cf14fa57d2d3.html)

## How do I switch between alias accounts?

You may have more than one alias account. All the alias accounts that you're assigned to can be accessed from the User Actions dropdown menu under your avatar. Select the *Alias Account Switcher* option and in the popup screen that opens, you can switch between your alias accounts or go back to your primary account.

## How will switching alias accounts affect what I see on the UI?

-   When you switch alias accounts, your avatar changes to help you distinguish between your primary account and a specific alias account.

-   You can search in an alias account - the search results reflect only what's relevant to the alias account.

-   You'll receive notifications that are relevant to the alias account.

-   From the User Actions menu, you can access *Settings* and *User Profile*. Access to the *Theme Manager*, *Administration Console*, and the *App Finder* isn't available from the User Actions menu.

-   When you open the *Settings* screen from the User Actions menu, you only have access to the following settings: *User Account*, *Appearance*, *Language & Region*, and *Advanced Settings*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you make changes to these settings, it can affect your primary account.

-   In the *Home* page:

    -   The *Applications* page isn't displayed in the top menu bar.

    -   The Home page content reflects only what's relevant for the alias account.


-   From the *Settings* screen, you won't have access to:

    -   Mobile Application

    -   Mobile Cards


-   From the *Advanced Settings* screen, you won't have access to the *Designate Blog Post Author* setting.

## Limitations

When you use an alias account, please note the following limitations:

-   Even though the avatar changes when you switch between alias accounts, when you open the avatar of an alias account, the user name of your primary account appears at the top of the User Actions Menu as well as in the header of the *Settings* screen.

-   In the shell header:

    -   The number of notifications received isn't displayed.

    -   *My Inbox* isn't displayed.
