# Activate Content for a Content Package

To make the content items in your content package available in your subaccount, you need to first make sure they're activated.

> ### Note:  
> This step isnâ€™t unique to the content packages flow - all content items need to be activated to make them available for use.

To activate the various content items if they're part of your content package, do the following:
