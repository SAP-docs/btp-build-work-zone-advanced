# Workspaces

You can create workspaces, configure them, and perform bulk actions on their content.

From the Administration Console, in the *Area & Workspace Configuration* \> *Workspaces Management* screen, you can manage workspaces centrally, for example, configure their settings, edit their content, and approve content as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Task



</th>
<th valign="top">

Description



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Create a workspace as a copy from an existing workspace



</td>
<td valign="top">

It's often faster to use an existing workspace as a basis for creating a new workspace.

To copy the structure, but not the content:

1.  Choose *Actions* \> *Copy*.

2.  Enter a new name and save.


To copy the structure and content:

1.  Choose *Actions* \> *Export Workspace*
2.  In the popup, click *Export* to export the workspace as a zip file.

3.  Reimport the workspace zip file with a different name


For more information about which artifacts are imported or exported, see [Exporting Workspaces](exporting-workspaces-1176af7.md).
