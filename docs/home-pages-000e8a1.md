Design the home page



</td>
<td valign="top">

Access the home page directly and design your company and area home pages.

1.  Click *Manage Home Page* to open the home page.

2.  Click :pencil2: to enter edit mode.

3.  In edit mode you can:

    -   Add and remove widgets and arrange them as required.

    -   Optimize page layout - check the box to automatically adjust height of widgets to align in rows. Widgets with smaller height dimensions automatically expand to align with the widget with the largest height dimension.

    -   Show text and image widgets as cards - selecting this option displays the widget as a card unless a widget setting is configured manually to override it.

    -   Include announcement - determine whether you want the announcement you created to be visible to users.

    -   Show or hide empty widgets - on a workpage, it’s possible to hide widgets that don’t have any content or widgets that the user doesn’t have permission to access. This makes the workpage less cluttered and users only see what’s relevant for them. To show these widgets again, you can select the *Show empty widgets* toggle that appears when the workpage is in edit mode.

    -   Add sub workpages, rearrange them in the order that you want, and determine who can access these workpages. In the dialog that opens you can specify if the workpage is available for all users or for specific user lists or workspace members.

2.  On the home page, click :pencil2: to open edit mode.

3.  On the site navigation bar, choose the :heavy_plus_sign: icon to add a page tab.

4.  In the *Tab Name* field, enter a name for the content, workspace, or external page that you want to link to.

5.  Select the *Link to existing content or external pages* option.

6.  Enter a valid URL for the link.

7.  Choose *Create*.


To delete a tab, provide a translation, or rename and edit the URL, choose the *Rearrange/Manage Tabs* icon next to the *\+* icon.
