# Approve Content

If your workspace administrator has configured a content approval workflow, content items have to be reviewed and approved by selected workspace members or workspace administrators before they can be published and made visible to the entire workspace.



## Configuring the Content Approval Policy

As a workspace administrator, you configure the approval policy in the *Workspace Admin Settings*.

1.  Open the <span class="SAP-icons"></span> menu and choose *Workspace Admin Settings*.

2.  Choose *Edit Workspace*.

3.  On the *PARTICIPATION* tab page, under *Content Approval*, you choose who has to approve the content items.

    You can apply the same approval policy to all content types or select a specific approval policy for specific content types.




## Approving Content Items

To find the content items that you have to check and approve, in the workspace, open the <span class="SAP-icons"></span> menu and choose *Pending Approval*.

Open a content item to review it and then approve or reject it. If you are rejecting an item, you can enter a reason for the rejection.
