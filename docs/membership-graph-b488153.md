# Membership graph

This graph displays the count of members, followers, email subscribers, and engaged users over a selected time frame.

Workspace administrators can choose to view the last 4 weeks, last 3 months, last 6 months, and last 12 months data. The graph gives workspace administrators an easy way to detect any trends or changes to the measures and take appropriate action. The values are captured at the end of each week \(Saturday\). Hovering over each date allows you to take a closer look at the values.

## Current email notifications pie chart

This chart shows the make-up of members who currently subscribe to none, immediate, daily, and weekly workspace email notifications. The data shown is not controlled by the selected time frame. Hover your cursor over each segment of the chart to view the numbers.
