# Content Templates

You can create templates for blog posts and wiki pages for all users to save them time.

From the *Area and Workspace* \> *Content Templates* screen, you can do the following:

You can create templates for standard format pages such as meeting minutes, design specifications, or how-to pages. The template can contain, for example, standardized titles and headings, images, and standard boilerplate text.

Users can then create blog posts and wiki pages from scratch or from the templates. When they create blog posts and wiki pages from the templates, all the content that you added to the template is automatically inserted and they can then modify and delete the content.



## Creating a template


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Task



</th>
<th valign="top">

Description



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Create a template from an existing template



</td>
<td valign="top">

It's often faster to use an existing template as a basis for the new template.

1.  In the row with the template that you want to copy, open the menu, and choose *Copy*.

    The template editor opens.

2.  Enter a new title.

3.  Change the contents as required.

4.  Save your changes.




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Create a template from scratch



</td>
<td valign="top">

If there's no suitable template that you can copy, create a new template.

1.  Choose *Create* and choose the type of template that you want to create.

2.  Enter a title.

3.  Enter text and format it as required.

4.  Save your entries.

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Publish a template



</td>
<td valign="top">

It's common to work on a template over several days to ensure that all of the required parts are included without adding too much material that isn't applicable to most uses of the template.

When you create a template, it can't be seen by anyone until you publish it. You can do this by toggling on the template next to the template name.
