# Using Push Notifications for Webhooks

Webhooks provide a means of tracking specific events that occur in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition and then sending the event notification metadata to third party applications that use them.

A possible use case for using webhooks notifications is when you have a corporate portal with official information, procedures and guidelines, and SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition as a digital experience solution, for collaboration and work with business applications. In this case, corporate updates can be published as blog posts in a dedicated workspace and re-posted to the corporate portal using the mechanism of webhooks. Note that it will be required to develop end points and functionality on the corporate portal side to handle incoming notifications from SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition webhooks.

Administrators can create and manage webhook subscriptions in the Admin Console, *External Solutions* \> *Notifications*.
