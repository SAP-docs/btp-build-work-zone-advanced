# Dashboard

The success of a workspace can be in part based on the interaction levels of its members. Access to immediate statistics on which members are most active, what they are most engaged with, which content items received the most attention, and which items and members are the least engaging or engaged can help determine what the next steps are for improvement or merit. Workspace administrators can click *Dashboard* on the workspace left side menu to view a usage dashboard that displays details for various activities within a workspace, from the previous four weeks to the previous 12 months.

> ### Note:  
> -   Alumni are excluded from Current Members, Current Email Subscribers, Most Engaged Members, and Most Engaging Items on the dashboard.

Before you work with the statistics and data that displays on your workspace dashboard, you'll need to select the time frames for the data.



## To run your workspace dashboard

1.  On the left side navigation for your workspace, click *Dashboard*.
2.  When starting up the Dashboard for the first time,you may see a message stating that it's preparing to initialize. You can navigate away from the page and return to it later. Subsequent dashboard displays for your workspace will take less time to generate.
3.  Once the dashboard is ready, and you happen to be on the same Dashboard page, click the *Click here to reload* link. Otherwise if you're navigating back from another page, just click *Dashboard* from the left side navigation.
4.  Once the dashboard displays, you can refine the time frame for the data. On the *Dashboard time frame* drop-down menu, choose from:

    -   Last 4 weeks
    -   Last 3 months
    -   Last 6 months
    -   Last 12 months

    All tiles in the dashboard will immediately update to reflect the new data. When you navigate away from the page and then return to the Dashboard, it will show the data for the default time frame of 4 weeks.

    > ### Note:  
    > The time frame does not apply to the pie charts displayed within the detailed Membership graph.




## To refresh the time frame on the workspace dashboard

> ### Note:  
> For performance reasons, each workspace dashboard updates once every 24 hours.

On the Dashboard time frame section, select a time frame. The dashboard will be updated shortly.



## Printer-friendly page view

You can click *Print* to generate a print preview version of the dashboard. The dashboard can be printed in landscape or portrait formats. Individual graphs in their entirety exist on their own pages without getting cut off.



## Download dashboard data

You can click *Download* beside the Print action to download a spreadsheet entitled "Workspace Dashboard.xsls". It contains multiple tabs of data for collaboration score, membership, most engaging items, and most engaged members data. In the downloaded file, you can see up to 200 most engaging items and 200 most engaged members.
