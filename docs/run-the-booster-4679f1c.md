## Running the Booster

**Previous Step:** [Prerequisites](prerequisites-9e78b62.md)

To run the booster:

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, use the breadcrumbs to access your global account.
2.  In the side menu, open the *Boosters* screen and click the *Get Started with SAP Build Work Zone, Advanced Edition* tile.
3.  SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition contains integration with SAP Build Process Automation service. SAP Build Process Automation is a citizen developer solution to adapt, improve, and innovate business processes with no-code workflow management and robotic process automation capabilities. If you are not planning to use SAP Build Process Automation, you can remove the service when you run the booster. If you decide later on that you do want to use it, see below instructions for how to add it.

## Manual Execution of the Booster

If you encounter technical issues in running the booster, here are the steps that the booster performs for you:

1.  Account setup:

    2.  Enable Cloud Foundry
    3.  Create a space
    4.  Assign entitlement \(list of services and number of quota for each service\)
    5.  Create a service instance and a service key for the SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition service **\(optional\)**
        1.  In the *Entitlements* screen of your subaccount, click *Configure Entitlements* and then click *Add Service Plans*.
        2.  select the *advanced* service plan of SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition \(not the standard\(application\)\), and click *Add Service Plans*.
