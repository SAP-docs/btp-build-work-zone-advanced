# Restoring Deleted Workspaces from the Trash

A workspace can be restored from the trash by the administrator.



If a workspace administrator has deleted a workspace by accident, or if it turns out that a recently deleted workspace is needed again, company administrators and support administrators can restore the workspace from the workspace administrator's trash.



> ### Note:  
> Company administrators and support administrators have to be enabled for Content Administration. If Content Administration is not enabled for the administrators, they can't access the trash folders of the workspace members to restore deleted workspaces. For information about how to enable Content Administration, see [Compliance and Content Administration](compliance-and-content-administration-9174e97.md).

> ### Note:  
> You can restore a workspace only if the workspace hasn't been purged yet.

You can restore a deleted workspace as follows:

1.  From the *Action* menu in the row of the user who deleted the workspace, choose *Access Trash*.

    > ### Note:  
    > In the trash folder, you can see only deleted workspaces, but no other deleted content.

2.  In the trash folder, select the workspace that you want to restore, and choose *Restore Items*.
