# Knowledge Base

To share knowledge about ideas, processes, solutions to common problems, or other topics in a workspace, workspace members can create a knowledge base by writing and categorizing knowledge base articles.

If the knowledge base is enabled for your workspace, the workspace has a *Knowledge Base* page that displays the knowledge base articles created in the workspace and where you can create knowledge base articles.

## Creating, Publishing and Editing Knowledge Base Articles

When you create a knowledge base article, you can select a template that provides a structure with subheadings and pre-entered text for the knowledge base article. With the rich text editor you can insert images, links, and videos into your text.

You can assign a category to the knowledge base article. The categories are used to filter the knowledge base articles on the *Knowledge Base* page.

You can choose to save your knowledge base article as a draft. The drafts are displayed on the *Knowledge Base* page.

When you publish a knowledge base article, you can set permissions and publish settings. By setting permissions, you decide if the workspace members can edit or modify the knowledge base article. You can also set the knowledge base article to *Hidden* so that it can only be seen by you and the workspace administrators. With the publish settings, you can configure that the knowledge base article is not published immediately but automatically at a later date, and you can set an expiry date.

When the knowledge base article is published, other users can tag, like, or bookmark the article and can post comments for the article.

If you edit a published knowledge base article, you create a new version of the article. On the *Knowledge Base* page, only the latest version of a knowledge base article is displayed. In the single item view of the knowledge base article, you can open the version history to view older versions.

## Company-Wide Knowledge Base

If your company administrator has enabled a company-wide knowledge base, you can find the knowledge base articles of all public workspaces and all other workspaces that you are a member of in the *Knowledge Base* tool. To open the *Knowledge Base* tool, in the top menu, choose *Tools* \> *Knowledge Base*.

## Managing the Knowledge Base as a Workspace Administrator

As a workspace administrator, you can create templates for knowledge base articles on the *Templates* tab of the *Knowledge Base* page in your workspace. You can add fields, such as text boxes or static content fields that cannot be removed or edited by the authors of knowledge base article.

On the *Knowledge Base* page, you can also:

-   Move knowledge base articles from one workspace to another workspace

-   Copy templates from one workspace to another workspace


As a workspace administrator, you can enable or disable the knowledge base feature for your workspace in the *Workspace Admin Settings*: Choose *Edit Workspace* and in the *SETUP* tab page under *Customize what is available in this workspace* you select or deselect the knowledge base feature. If you disable the knowledge base feature after knowledge base articles have been created and published for the workspace, the articles are no longer displayed in the workspace and the company-wide knowledge base.
