# Transporting Home Pages and Workspaces

You can transport content items such as home pages, workspaces, and workspace templates.

To transport content items such as home pages, workspaces, and workspace templates between subaccounts, you simply export the content from the source system and import the exported file back into the target system.

> ### Remember:  
> Before you import content:
> 
> -   Back up any content you may need for future use. Content with the same names will be overwritten.
> 
> -   Permissions configured for a content creator’s user account in the destination system must match that in the source system.
