# How to Search in Your Site

You can search for content in your site or for the applications assigned to your roles.

Using the search tool in the header bar of your site, you can use one of the following search options depending on the search mechanism that is enabled by the administrator.

-   Standard search

    This is a built-in search mechanism that allows you to search for content in your site such as people, workspaces, workpages, and apps that are assigned to your roles.

-   Enterprise search

    If enabled, and depending on whether the S/4 HANA systems have been configured to work with enterprise search, you'll be able to search for S/4 HANA applications in all S/4 HANA systems, as well as local apps \(for example, HTML5 apps, federated apps, and manually added apps that you've added to your subaccount\). Searching for site content from the search bar, is not available if enterprise search is enabled.

    > ### Note:  
    > Even if enterprise search is enabled, you can still use the site search by adding a dedicated *Search* widget to a workpage. For more information, see [How to Add Content to Workspaces](how-to-add-content-to-workspaces-19bf8aa.md).

## Additional Info



### Search Criteria

You can enter search terms that include letters, numbers, or characters. By default, the search mechanism uses wild cards. However, if you specify multiple words, the search returns only matches that contain all words.

The following options are available to restrict your search:

-   Select a category from the dropdown menu to find only matches that are assigned to this category

-   Enclose your search term in double quotation marks \("\) to find exact matches for the search term

-   Add a hashtag \(\#\) before your search term to find matches for specific tags



### Search Results

When you enter search terms into the search text field, a dropdown list immediately shows up to 10 results that match your current search criteria. The results are grouped by category. To view the complete list of search results, choose *View All*. You can then sort the results or refine your search as required.

> ### Note:  
> If the number of total matches exceeds 10, the matches are added to the dropdown list according to their relevance. This means that the dropdown list might not include all categories for which search results exist.



### Searching in Context

Searches can be executed in context of the screen in focus.

When searching from a workpage in a workspace, you can choose to search the workspace that you're in \(using "This Workspace" filter\). You can also search by any of the other filters \(for example, All, Content, Events, Forums, Workspaces, Knowledge Base, Messages, People, Tasks, and Tags\). You can also search other workspaces that you're a member of, as well as public workspaces.



### Restrictions

The following restriction applies:

When you upload documents, they are automatically indexed and taken into account for the search. This also applies to tagged content within a document. However, indexing is not performed for content items larger than 50 MB. For this reason, large content items are not included in the search results.
