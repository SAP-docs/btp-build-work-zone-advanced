# Run Workspace Reports

Workspace reports display information about the contributions and activities of workspace members. The reports can be downloaded as CSV files.



1.  Open your workspace and click <span class="SAP-icons">î‡ž</span> \(page navigator\).

2.  Click *Reports*.

3.  Select the options for the report that you want to run:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Option


    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Select Report*


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select the type of report that you want to run.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Specify Date Range*


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Choose a start date and end date for the period to be covered by your report.

    The date range can't span more than three months.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Show Report Header*


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Include report headings indicating the report name and the settings used for the report \(such as the time frame and the name of the workspace\).


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Type*


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Select the output format of the report.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
4.  Click *Request report*.

    The report is queued to run. Your report runs almost immediately, unless there are multiple reports scheduled in the queue. Some reports with large amounts of data to process, such as the workspace activity report, can take up to about an hour to run.

    Queued and completed reports are listed below the report options. The queued and completed reports are visible to all administrators.

5.  To download your report, click the name of your report in the table below the report options section of the page. This opens your browser's download options dialog box.

    It may be necessary to reload the page in your browser to see the results of a recently run report.
