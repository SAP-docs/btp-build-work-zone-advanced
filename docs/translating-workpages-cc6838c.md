# Translating Workpages

To support organizations with employees who understand multiple languages, you can provide translations for texts on workpages.



You can translate the following:

-   Navigation tab titles in a workspace

-   Text in text widgets

-   Titles and captions in widgets


Users see the translations of workpages based on their preferred language settings. If a translation is not available for their preferred language, they see the original, untranslated text.

To translate a workpage, do the following:

1.  Open the *Workspace editor* menu \(:magic_wand:\).

2.  Choose *Translate*.

3.  Select the language that you want to work in from the dropdown menu.

4.  Enter a translation for the title of the workpage.

    The page title is displayed as the navigation tab for the workpage

5.  Enter translations for the texts in text widgets.

6.  To enter translations for widget titles, click next to the widget title and choose *Translate*. Then enter the translation for the widget title.

7.  Publish the translation of the workpage or save it as a draft.

    Similar to saving a workpage as a draft, you can also save translations as a draft. Draft translations are not visible to end users. As an administrator, you can view either draft translations or published translations. You can resume editing a draft, delete a draft, or publish a draft. Each time you publish a translation, a new version of the workpage is created in the version history.
