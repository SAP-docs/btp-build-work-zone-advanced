*Optimized Site Loading*



</td>
<td valign="top">

Enables the caching of a site in the browser cache, to expedite its loading.

*Asynchronous Module Loading*

When using asynchronous loading, the browser loads the site and apps that include SAPUI5 modules in parallel. This loading mode is much faster than synchronous loading \(default\), where the site and its content are loaded sequentially

> ### Note:  
> Asynchronous loading is recommended for faster and more secure site loading and we strongly encourage you to use this feature.
> 
> However to ensure the proper rendering of your custom apps and plugins, make sure to test your custom components in asynchronous mode to see if any adaptations need to be made and make sure they're not using 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' directives.
> 
> For more information about asynchronous loading, see the [SAPUI5 Documentation.](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/676b636446c94eada183b1218a824717)

## User Capabilities

These settings manage user access to tools and screens from the User Actions menu \(located under the user's avatar\). The User Actions menu offers a range of user-specific services that help you determine what users can or cannot personalize in their site. This is what a typical User Actions menu looks like depending on your configuration.
