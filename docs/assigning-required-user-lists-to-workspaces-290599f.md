# Assigning Required User Lists to Workspaces

You can use user liststo assign large numbers of users to a workspace all at one time.



If you **assign** a user list to a specific workspace, all users on the list are assigned to this workspace. If you've set up a user agreement \(*terms of use*\) for the workspace, the users have to accept the terms of use before they can access the workspace. You can use this feature, for example, for workspaces that are designed to broadcast required information to specific parts of your organization, such as departments or specialist groups.

> ### Note:  
> Assigned members don't have the option to leave the workspace. However, they can unfollow the workspace feed as an alternative.

Assign a user list to a workspace as follows:

1.  In the workspace, choose *\+Invite* and switch to the *User Lists* page tab.

2.  In the *Add User List* text box, type the name of the user list into the text box.

3.  Click *Save*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If a required user list is changed after you saved the assignment, for example if users are deleted or added to the user list by the company administrator, the list of members in the workspace is updated automatically.

### Enabling Silent Assignments

If you don't want notifications sent to each user on a specific user list that you've assigned to a workspace, you can enable silent assignments in the workspace settings:

1.  In the workspace, open the <span class="SAP-icons">î‡²</span> menu and choose *Workspace Admin Settings* \> *Edit Workspace*.

2.  On the *GENERAL* tab page, select the option *Enable Silent Assignments*.


If you enable silent assignments, administrators can invite user lists to their workspace without triggering a notification to the invited users \(no bell notification, feed entries, or e-mail notifications informing them about their assignment to the workspace. The invited users are automatically assigned to the workspace as members.
