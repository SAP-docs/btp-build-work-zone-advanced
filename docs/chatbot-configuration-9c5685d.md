# Chatbot Configuration

You can implement multiple chatbots in SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition by configuring them in the Administration Console.



In the Administration Console, you create, configure, and enable chatbots so that users can select a chatbot that suits the area they're working in. They can also switch between the available chatbots - the chatbots that are available to them depends on what you have enabled.

To manage your chatbots, do the following:

1.  From the Administration Console, expand the *External Integrations* area and select *Chatbot Configuration*.

2.  From this screen, manage the chatbots as follows:

    -   Add a new chatbot.

        For more information, see [Chatbots](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7d3b9c7211ca4d7a9630b524205ee836/Cloud/en-US/1b275f8e2b624a1092f07b864b34515c.html) in the SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition Developer Guide.

    -   Enable the chatbot launcher to display its icon <span class="SAP-icons">îˆ¸</span> at the bottom right of the screen. When users click this icon, they'll be able to select from a list of available chatbots according to the information they need.

    -   Enable one or more chatbots using the toggle button next to it - this makes the chatbot available for users to select when they click on the chatbot launcher.

    -   Edit or delete an existing chatbot using the relevant icons next to each chatbot.
