# About Workspaces

A workspace is a collaborative environment that is designed to encourage users to share and communicate with each other about a specific subject, project, event, goal, or a team from a specific department.

## Overview

When you create a workspace, you automatically become the workspace administrator. However, you can designate other members to be an admin too. Users who join a workspace are called members.

Under the *Workspaces*, menu item, you can navigate to and filter the workspaces according to those that you recently viewed, your favorite workspaces, and you can view all workspaces including those you manage.
