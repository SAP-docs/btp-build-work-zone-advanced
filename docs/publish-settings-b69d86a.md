# Publish Settings

If you don't want to publish content items immediately, but rather on a specific date, you can schedule automatic publishing. You can also set an expiry date for a content item after which it's no longer visible.

1.  At the bottom of the rich text editor, click *Publish*.
2.  In the *Publish* dialog, choose *Options*.
3.  In the *Publish Settings* dialog, you can make following settings:

    -   To set a publication date, select *Automatically publish* and choose the date and time.

> ### Note:  
> If a blog, wiki, or knowledge base article includes attachments, they are also published on the publication date. If you change the publication settings later, only the blog and wiki adhere to those settings. The attachments are unaffected by the change in publication settings and remain available in the workspace unless you manually delete them.
