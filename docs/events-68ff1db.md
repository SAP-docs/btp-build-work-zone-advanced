# Events

In a workspace, you can use events to schedule activities or meetings with other workspace members.



<a name="loio68ff1db7b1db4295b1eac53d46b21882__section_brp_r2q_l5b"/>

## Overview

The events for a workspace are displayed on the *Events* page of the workspace. You can also view all events in which you're participating in the *Calendar* tool. Events can be displayed as a calendar \(month, week, or day\), or as a list. When you hover over an event in the calendar view, you see a popup view of the event with some basic information. From this popup, you can also edit or export the event. Clicking on an empty space on the calendar allows you to quickly create new events.

Creating an event creates a feed notification in the workspace’s feed.

## Creating Events

To create an event in a workspace, follow these steps:

1.  In a workspace, click :heavy_plus_sign: on the right to add an *Events* page tab.

2.  In the calendar screen that opens, click *\+ Create*.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can also create a new event by clicking on a specific date in the calendar view.

3.  In the *New Event* dialog box, fill in the following information:

    1.  Enter any name that describes your event - this field is required.

    2.  Enter a start date and time, end date and time, and select the time zone. You can also mark an event as *All Day*, removing the need to enter the start and end time.

    3.  Use the rich text editor to enter an event description. This is free text where you can create a visual invitation to the event or describe what the event is about. You can use formatting, copy and paste texts, and you can add images. In feeds, email notifications, and exports to Microsoft Outlook reminders, the event description displays plain text. Single item view of the event description is formatted.

    4.  Specify the location, attach agenda items or other content, choose a category from a custom or preset list \(for example, meeting, social, training\), choose a priority \(for example, normal, high, and low\), and add tags.

    5.  If the event occurs often, you can also set its recurrence up to 100 occurrences. You can select a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly recurrence, or choose not to repeat the event at all.


4.  To actually create the event, you have the following options:
    -   Click *Create* - use this option to create an event that is visible to all workspace members. Later, after you've created the event, you can invite members to join.

    -   Click *Create and Invite* - use this option if you want to create an event and immediately invite other workspace members to it.



Once an event is created, a workspace feed event is generated, and the event is visible to all workspace members. Anyone in the workspace can respond, comment, like, create tasks, add tags, and search for your events.

## Viewing your event

To see all your events, you can open the calendar in one of the following ways:

-   From the *Events* page tab that you created above.

-   Under *Tools* in the top menu bar, select *Calendar*. From this view, you can click *My Events and Away Alerts* to see an aggregated view of all events for which you've responded \(Join or Maybe\), and events that you’ve been invited to but haven’t yet responded, as well as any of your planned absences. To review your event invitations that you haven’t yet responded to, click *Event Invitations*.

## Inviting members to your event

Once you've created an event in your workspace, you as the host can invite all or some of the members of the workspace to your event. You can invite them to a single occurrence or to an entire recurring series. Notifications aren’t sent to the host when someone responds. Instead, a feed event is generated when someone responds, and the response can be accompanied by a comment.

> ### Note:  
> The event feed is displayed on the event page, not on the workspace feed page.

To invite members, click *Create and Invite* or *Invite Members*, then simply choose from the list of workspace members, or search for them by name or email.

## Privacy and Permissions

An event’s details, its current guest list, the member responses, and any accompanying comments are visible to everyone in the workspace, regardless of whether they’re directly participating in the event or not. There are no “private events” that are only visible to specific workspace members. If you want an event to be private, create it inside a sub workspace instead.

Only the event host can invite others, edit, delete, and restore their own events.

Workspace admins can always invite, edit, delete, and restore any event.
