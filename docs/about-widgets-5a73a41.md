## Introduction

When you add a widget to a workpage, you're adding specific content of the widget type. For example, if you select an *Image* widget type from the widget gallery, you can select any image that you've saved on your computer. You can then define the image settings such as adding a caption, changing the widget's style, as well as the layout and alignment.

To add widgets to your workpages, you use a tool called the workpage editor. You can insert, remove, edit, and reposition widgets as needed. For more information, see: [How to Add Content to Workspaces](how-to-add-content-to-workspaces-19bf8aa.md).



Your site contains a variety of out-of-the box widgets. Here are some examples for you to see:

Select an image from a local computer folder or directly from the workspace content repository.

> ### Note:  
> When you click and drag the bottom edge of an image widget to resize it, a new guideline icon appears to help you align the edge with another widget in the same row. As you drag the guideline, it will automatically snap to the bottom edge alignment matching the other widget.

You also have some editing options such as adding a title, caption, link to a website, or even changing the widget style.

> ### Note:  
> There's an option to select a checkbox called *Show text and image widgets as cards*. Selecting this option, displays your image widgets as cards. In other words, the widgets will display colors, borders, and rounded corners.
> 
> When you edit the widget, you can override this setting by choosing one of the following options:
> 
> -   *Follow page setting*
