# Configure Access to Business Records

After you registered your external application, created any required annotations files, and registered your business records, your external data is available for use in a workspace.



To use a business record, you can:

-   Create a workspace with a business record as it's primary object.
-   Feature a business record in a workspace.
-   In the *Features* screen, you can enable or disable that business record feed about user actions is displayed on the profile pages of the users.
-   You can access a document repository or a library from a workspace by adding it as an external folder.
