# Wiki Pages

You can create wiki pages in workspaces or on your profile page.

Unlike blog posts, wiki pages that are published with the permission level *Full* can be edited not only by the creator of the page, but also by other users. When others view your wiki page, they can choose to follow it so that they see feed activity whenever you update it or when other users post comments.

Wikis can include different types of text, tables, pictures, or video content. In addition, you can attach any type of file to a wiki page or insert a dynamic widget. Users can assign existing tags to a wiki page.

Wiki pages can be edited in a draft mode to be published and made available to others later. In draft mode, a wiki page is only available to its creator. A version history of each document is available and older versions can be restored at any time.

You can create a wiki page in workspaces and profile pages.

To create a wiki page, go to a workspace or to your profile page and do the following:

****

<td valign="top">

From the *\+ Create* dropdown menu, select *Wiki Page*.



</td>
<td valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

When you publish a wiki page, you can set permissions in the *Publish* dialog.
