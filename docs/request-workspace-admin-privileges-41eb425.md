# Request Workspace Admin Privileges

As a member of a workspace, you can send a request to a workspace administrator to get admin privileges for a workspace that you’re a member of.



To send a request to get admin privileges for a workspace, do the following:

1.  Go to the workspace that you want admin permissions for.
2.  In the <span class="SAP-icons"></span> dropdown menu, choose *My Workspace Settings*.
3.  From the dropdown menu, choose *Request Workspace Admin Privileges*.

    When the workspace administrator accepts your request, you have access to the *Workspace Admin Settings* and to the *Workpage editor* menu \(:magic_wand:\).


> ### Note:  
> External users can’t become workspace administrators.
