## Overall score

On the Overall tab, the overall score is visualized as a dial which is made up of three equal segments: follower score, email subscribers score, and engaged users score. Based on the historical time frame selected, a score is awarded to each individual category, and summarized in the table on the right.

Each category score is a value between 0 and 33.3, rounded to the nearest 0.1. The overall score is a value between 0 and 100, rounded to the nearest 1, and is the sum of the three category scores. An overall score rating is assigned based on the following: Fair \(< 50 points\), Good \(\>=50 and <70 points\), Excellent \(\>=70 and <100\), Perfect \(100\). The value change and percent change in score compared to the previous period also displays under the dial, where applicable.

To view a category for more details, click the category on the dial or click the category tab. You can also click *View Details* at the bottom of the tile to view the line graphs that visually represent the scores over time. See [Collaboration score graph](collaboration-score-graph-895ee36.md) for more details.
