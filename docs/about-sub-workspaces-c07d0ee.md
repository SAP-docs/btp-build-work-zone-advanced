# About Sub-Workspaces

Sub-workspaces can contain a subset of the members of the main workspace. This allows the members of the sub-workspace to have a distinct environment in which they can work together.

To create a sub-workspace, you first have to add a *Sub-Workspaces* navigation tab to the workspace.

Sub-workspace members must be members of the main workspace. If a member of the sub-workspace is removed from the main workspace, they are also removed from the sub-workspace. Inviting a user to a sub-workspace also invites them to the main workspace if they arenâ€™t already a member.

Only administrators of the main workspace can create sub-workspaces. They can delegate the administration of sub-workspaces by promoting other members of the sub-workspace to sub-workspace administrators.

When you create a sub-workspace, you can select a workspace template and configure the workspace in the same way as you would for a main workspace.
