## Recording Videos

**Best practices**

-   Keep your videos short. Break longer videos into smaller sessions.

-   Videos are more effective when they focus on a single topic.

-   If possible, use a headset while recording to make sure that your audio is clear.

## Using Thumbnail Images

After you add a video to your site, you can select a thumbnail image to help others identify it visually among other content items. When you create or upload a video, you can customize the thumbnail image that appears when the video displays in widgets, playlists, views, feed posts, or in the mobile app.

To select a video thumbnail image:

1.  Open your video.

2.  Choose *Video Manager* \> *Thumbnails*.

3.  Select one of the five thumbnails that are automatically chosen from frames within your video.

    You can also upload a new image and then crop, zoom, or pan the image if necessary.

4.  Save your selection.


The video thumbnail is bundled with the video. They're subject together to content approval, if configured. For example, if the thumbnail is changed, the video and thumbnail are both subject to content approval.
