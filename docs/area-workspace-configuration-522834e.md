# Area & Workspace Configuration

You can organize the internal structure of your site in the *Area & Workspace Configuration* section.



## Organizing the internal structure

To represent the structure of your company, you have the following levels:

-   Company

    Information on company level is visible to all users in your company.

    > ### Note:  
    > There can only be one company level. If you want to add mulitple subsiduaries or business areas, you can create different administrative areas for them.

-   Administrative area

    An administrative area is a designated space for lines of business, where subject matter experts can manage their content and interact with each other. Areas are defined by their users, they have their own designated home pages, you can theme them separately, and you define the widgets and applications that are available for them.

    Within an administrative area, all news, feeds, and content are shared only among the users who are assigned to the administrative area.


For both levels, company and area, you can use the following components:

-   Home page

    This page is the landing page for each of the levels. You use the page designer to add widgets to your pages.

    On the company level, there's also a default home page for external users that administrators can adapt.

-   A feed shows the feed items that apply to either the company or area.

-   Pages on each level allow you to partition content such as forums or filing of uploaded documents.

    On the company level, there are pages for business records, apps, and tools.

On the *Features* page, the company administrator can enable or disable that all users can create their own workspaces.
