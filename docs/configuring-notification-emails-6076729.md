# Configuring Notification Emails

The notification emails that a user receives are determined by several settings that company administrators configure and a setting that users configure in their accounts.

The site sends emails to inform users about all kinds of activities, new and changed content on the home page and in the workspaces that users are members of.

Notification emails are only sent if there's new or changed content that the users can be notified of.



## Step 1: Enable Emails Notifications

1.  In the *Administration Console*, choose *Compliance and Security* \> *Security*.
2.  In the *E-Mail Settings* section, select *Allow SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition to send members content via e-mail*.
3.  Save your changes.




## Step 2: Enable Users to Receive Daily Email Alerts and Active Task Reminders

1.  In *Feature Enablement* \> *Features*, go to the *Feature Management* section.
2.  Select the *Send daily alert emails to all members* option to allow users to receive the notification emails listed in the *Daily Emails* section of their *Account Settings* \> *Email Settings* screen.

    Disabling this option prevents users from receiving daily alert emails regardless of any options that they may have checked in the *Daily Summary Emails* section in their settings.

3.  Select the *Send active task reminder to all members* option to allow users to receive email reminders about their not completed tasks.

    Disabling this option prevents users from receiving active task reminders regardless of whether they've checked the *Active tasks reminder* option in the *Daily Emails* section in their settings.

4.  Save your changes.




## Optional: Prevent Individual Users from Receiving Notification Emails

Only configure this setting if you want to exclude specific users from receiving notification emails.

The default setting is *Enable Emails*.

1.  Under *Users*, click either the *Internal Users* or *External Users* screens.
2.  In the row for the specific user, from the *Action* dropdown menu, choose *Edit*.

    The user's profile page appears.

3.  In the *Email Settings* section, select *Stop all emails*.
