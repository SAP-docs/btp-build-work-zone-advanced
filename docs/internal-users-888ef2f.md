# Internal Users

Company or area internal users are employees of the company and are managed from the Administration Console.



Depending on whether you are at company level or switch to an administrative area, the *Internal Users* screen shows different options: At company level, you manage general user settings, whereas on the administrative area level, you manage users specifically of the chosen area.

    -   *Review Usage* takes you to the *Content Adminisration* screen. You need to enable content administration in order to create a usage report of the user.


3.  *Acess Trash* - If a workspace administrator has deleted a workspace by accident, or if it turns out that a recently deleted workspace is needed again, company administrators and support administrators can restore the workspace from the workspace administrator's trash.

Permanently remove alumni profile information \(personal data erasure\)



</td>
<td valign="top">

People who have left your organization or people who should no longer be able to access the site, become alumni when you deactivate their users.

To permanently remove all profile information \(for example, first name, last name, email address, office location\) for an alumni account or never-used account \(user was invited but never logged in\):

-   From the *Action* menu, choose *Clear Profile*.


The alumni profile no longer appears in search results. For never-used accounts, the invitation to join is revoked.

> ### Note:  
> The setting deletes the profile information, not the alumni user's content and feed items.

On the *Feature Enablement* \> *Features* page, you can configure this setting globally.

-   To area administrators

    -   Enable users to create their own workspaces

    -   Create a workspace for external users


-   To workspace administrators

    -   Change the external document integration name

    -   Configure repositories at the workspace level for Microsoft Office 365 SharePoint
